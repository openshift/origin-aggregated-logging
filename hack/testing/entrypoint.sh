#!/bin/bash

# This script serves as a common entrypoint for CI infra
# as well as developers looking to run test suites for the
# project. The script can either set up a cluster to test
# or run against a cluster that is already up.
#
# Cluster end-to-end tests will be run first, followed by
# other test suites. If a specific suite or suites are req-
# uested with $SUITE, only that suite will be run.
#
# This script expects the following environment variables:
#  - TEST_ONLY: do not set up a cluster. Must be paired with
#    a $KUEBCONFIG that points to the cluster to test
#  - SUITE: a regex that will choose which test suites are
#    run. Test suite entrypoints exist under hack/testing/
#    with the test- prefix. The regex in $SUITE is a simple
#    filter.
#  - JUNIT_REPORT: generate a jUnit XML report for tests
