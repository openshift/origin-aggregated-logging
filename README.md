# Origin-Aggregated-Logging [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging)

This repo contains the image definitions of the components of the logging
stack as well as tools for building and deploying them.

To generate the necessary images from github source in your OpenShift
Origin deployment, follow directions below.

To deploy the components from built or supplied images, see the
[deployer](./deployer).

NOTE: If you are running OpenShift Origin using the
[All-In-One docker container](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/getting_started/administrators.html#running-in-a-docker-container)
method, you MUST add `-v /var/log:/var/log` to the `docker` command line.
OpenShift must have access to the container logs in order for Fluentd to read
and process them.

## Components

The logging subsystem consists of multiple components commonly abbreviated
as the "ELK" stack (though modified here to be the "EFK" stack).

### ElasticSearch

ElasticSearch is a Lucene-based indexing object store into which all logs
are fed. It should be deployed with redundancy, can be scaled up using
more replicas, and should use persistent storage.

### Fluentd

Fluentd is responsible for gathering log entries from nodes, enriching
them with metadata, and feeding them into ElasticSearch.

### Kibana

Kibana presents a web UI for browsing and visualizing logs in ElasticSearch.

### Logging auth proxy

In order to authenticate the Kibana user against OpenShift's Oauth2, a
proxy is required that runs in front of Kibana.

### Deployer

The deployer enables the user to generate all of the necessary
key/certs/secrets and deploy all of the components in concert.

### Curator

Curator allows the admin to remove old indices from Elasticsearch on a per-project
basis.

# Defining local builds

Choose the project you want to hold your logging infrastructure. It can be
any project.

Instantiate the [dev-builds template](hack/templates/dev-builds.yaml)
to define BuildConfigs for all images and ImageStreams to hold their
output. You can do this before or after deployment, but before is
recommended. A logging deployment defines the same ImageStreams, so it
is normal to see errors about already-defined ImageStreams when building
from source and deploying. Normally existing ImageStreams are deleted
at installation to enable redeployment with different images. To prevent
your customized ImageStreams from being deleted, ensure that they are not
labeled with `logging-infra=support` like those generated by the deployer.

The template has parameters to specify the repository and branch to use
for the builds. The defaults are for origin master. To develop your own
images, you can specify your own repos and branches as needed.

A word about the openshift-auth-proxy: it depends on the "node" base
image, which is intended to be the DockerHub nodejs base image. If you
have defined all the standard templates, they include a nodejs builder image
that is also called "node", and this will be used instead of the intended
base image, causing the build to fail. You can delete it to resolve this
problem:

    oc delete is/node -n openshift

The builds should start once defined; if any fail, you can retry them with:

    oc start-build <component>

e.g.

    oc start-build openshift-auth-proxy

Once these builds complete successfully the ImageStreams will be
populated and you can use them for a deployment. You will need to
specify an `INDEX_PREFIX` pointing to their registry location, which
you can get from:

    $ oc get is
    NAME                    DOCKER REPO
    logging-deployment      172.30.90.128:5000/logs/logging-deployment

In order to run a deployment with these images, you would process the
[deployer template](deployer/deployer.yaml) with the
`IMAGE_PREFIX=172.30.90.128:5000/logs/` parameter. Proceed to the
[deployer instructions](./deployer) to run a deployment.

## Running the deployer script locally

When developing the deployer, it is fairly tedious to rebuild the image
and redeploy it just for tiny iterative changes.  The deployer script
is designed to be run either in the deployer image or directly. It
requires the openshift and oc binaries as well as the Java 8 JDK. When
run directly, it will use your current client context to create all
the objects, but you must still specify at least the PROJECT env var in
order to create everything with the right parameters. E.g.:

    cd deployer
    PROJECT=logging ./run.sh

There are a number of env vars this script looks at which are useful
when running directly; check the script headers for details.

## EFK Health

Determining the health of an EFK deployment and if it is running can be assessed
by running the `check-EFK-running.sh` and `check-logs.sh` [e2e tests](hack/testing/).
Additionally, see [Checking EFK Health](deployer/README.md#checking-efk-health).
