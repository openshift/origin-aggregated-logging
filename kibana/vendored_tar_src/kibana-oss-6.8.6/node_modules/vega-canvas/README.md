# vega-canvas

[Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and [Image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/Image)  object instantiation utilities.
Creates an [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), using either the web browser DOM or a [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) library.

This module attempts three forms of canvas creation, in this order:
- If in a browser environment, use DOM methods to create a new canvas.
- If the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) library is present, use that.
- If the [node-canvas-prebuilt](https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt) library is present, use that.
- Otherwise, return `null`.

To enable error-free build processes for client-side code, **this module does not include any direct or optional dependencies on the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) and [node-canvas-prebuilt](https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt) libraries**. Projects that use this module and require canvas support for server-side (node.js) operations must include the desired dependencies in their own `package.json` file. Projects that use this module should also ensure that bundlers such as Webpack and Browserify appropriately exclude canvas dependencies by including `{"canvas": null, "canvas-prebuilt": null}` under the `"browser"` property in their `package.json` file.

_Note:_ As a result of the design decision to exclude direct dependencies on canvas libraries, linking to this module locally via `npm link` can result in `require(...)` errors due to node's module resolution algorithm. To ensure successful resolution of canvas libraries, this module should be included as a direct subfolder (not a symlink).

## API Reference

<a name="canvas" href="#canvas">#</a>
vega.<b>canvas</b>([<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>])
[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/index.js "Source")

Creates a new [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) instance, with an optional *width* and *height* (in pixels). If *width* and *height* are omitted, creates a _0 x 0_ canvas. This method first attempts to create a canvas using the DOM `document.createElement` method. If that fails, the method then attempts to instantiate a canvas using the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) library. Failing that, the method tries the [node-canvas-prebuilt](https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt) library. If all attempts fail, returns `null`.

<a name="domCanvas" href="#domCanvas">#</a>
vega.<b>domCanvas</b>([<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>])
[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/src/domCanvas.js "Source")

Creates a new [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) instance, with an optional *width* and *height* (in pixels). If *width* and *height* are omitted, creates a _0 x 0_ canvas. This method first attempts to create a canvas using the DOM `document.createElement` method. If that fails, returns `null`.

<a name="nodeCanvas" href="#nodeCanvas">#</a>
vega.<b>nodeCanvas</b>([<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>])
[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/src/nodeCanvas.js "Source")

Creates a new [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) instance, with an optional *width* and *height* (in pixels). If *width* and *height* are omitted, creates a _0 x 0_ canvas. This method attempts to instantiate a canvas using using the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) library. If that fails, it attempts to use the [node-canvas-prebuilt](https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt) library. If all attempts fail, returns `null`.

<a name="image" href="#image">#</a>
vega.<b>image</b>()
[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/index.js "Source")

Returns a reference to the [Image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/Image) constructor. In a web browser environment, simply returns the built-in `Image` object. Otherwise, attempts to return the `Image` instance exported by a node canvas library. If all attempts to find a canvas library fail, returns `null`.
