<h1>Rsyslog Debug Support<a class="headerlink" href="#rsyslog-debug-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For harder to find issues, rsyslog has integrated debug support. Usually,
this is not required for finding configuration issues but rather
to hunt for program or plugin bugs. However, there are several
occasions where debug log has proven to be quite helpful in finding
out configuration issues.</p>
<p>Part of debug supports is activated by
adding the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--enable-rtinst</span></code> ./configure option (“rtinst” means runtime
instrumentation). Turning debugging on obviously costs some performance
(in some cases considerable). For typical cases, runtime instrumentation
is <em>not</em> required.</p>
<div class="section" id="signals-supported">
<h2>Signals supported<a class="headerlink" href="#signals-supported" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>SIGUSR1</strong> - turns debug messages on and off. Note that for this signal
to work, rsyslogd must be running with debugging enabled, either via the
-d command line switch or the environment options specified below. It is
<strong>not</strong> required that rsyslog was compiled with debugging enabled (but
depending on the settings this may lead to better debug info).</p>
<p><strong>SIGUSR2</strong> - outputs debug information (including active threads and a
call stack) for the state when SIGUSR2 was received. This is a one-time
output. Can be sent as often as the user likes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this signal <strong>may go away</strong> in later releases and may be
replaced by something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environment-variables">
<h2>Environment Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#environment-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two environment variables that set several debug settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The “RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG” (sample:
&nbsp;RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG=”/path/to/debuglog/debug.log”) writes (allmost) all debug
message to the specified log file in addition to stdout. Some system
messages (e.g. segfault or abort message) are not written to the file
as we can not capture them.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Runtime debug support is controlled by “RSYSLOG_DEBUG”.</p>
<p>The “RSYSLOG_DEBUG” environment variable contains an option string
with the following options possible (all are case insensitive):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>LogFuncFlow</strong> - print out the logical flow of functions
(entering and exiting them)</li>
<li><strong>FileTrace</strong> - specifies which files to trace LogFuncFlow. If
<strong>not</strong> set (the default), a LogFuncFlow trace is provided for all
files. Set to limit it to the files specified. FileTrace may be
specified multiple times, one file each (e.g. export
RSYSLOG_DEBUG=”LogFuncFlow FileTrace=vm.c FileTrace=expr.c”</li>
<li><strong>PrintFuncDB</strong> - print the content of the debug function database
whenever debug information is printed (e.g. abort case)!</li>
<li><strong>PrintAllDebugInfoOnExit</strong> - print all debug information
immediately before rsyslogd exits (currently not implemented!)</li>
<li><strong>PrintMutexAction</strong> - print mutex action as it happens. Useful
for finding deadlocks and such.</li>
<li><strong>NoLogTimeStamp</strong> - do not prefix log lines with a timestamp
(default is to do that).</li>
<li><strong>NoStdOut</strong> - do not emit debug messages to stdout. If
RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG is not set, this means no messages will be
displayed at all.</li>
<li><strong>Debug</strong> - if present, turns on the debug system and enables
debug output</li>
<li><strong>DebugOnDemand</strong> - if present, turns on the debug system but does
not enable debug output itself. You need to send SIGUSR1 to turn
it on when desired.</li>
<li><strong>OutputTidToStderr</strong> - if present, makes rsyslog output
information about the thread id (tid) of newly created processes to
stderr. Note that not necessarily all new threads are reported
(depends on the code, e.g. of plugins). This is only available
under Linux. This usually does NOT work when privileges have been
dropped (that’s not a bug, but the way it is).</li>
<li><strong>help</strong> - display a very short list of commands - hopefully a
life saver if you can’t access the documentation…</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual options are separated by spaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="why-environment-variables">
<h3>Why Environment Variables?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-environment-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You may ask why we use environment variables for debug-system parameters
and not the usual rsyslog.conf configuration commands. After all,
environment variables force one to change distro-specific configuration
files, whereas regular configuration directives would fit nicely into
the one central rsyslog.conf.</p>
<p>The problem here is that many settings of the debug system must be
initialized before the full rsyslog engine starts up. At that point,
there is no such thing like rsyslog.conf or the objects needed to
process it present in an running instance. And even if we would enable
to change settings some time later, that would mean that we can not
correctly monitor (and debug) the initial startup phase of rsyslogd.
What makes matters worse is that during this startup phase (and never
again later!) some of the base debug structure needs to be created, at
least if the build is configured for that (many of these things only
happen in –enable-rtinst mode). So if we do not initialize the debug
system <strong>before</strong> actually starting up the rsyslog core, we get a number
of data structures wrong.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we utilize environment variables to initialize and
configure the debugging system. We understand this may be somewhat
painful, but now you know there are at least some good reasons for doing
so.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, if you have a too hard time to set debug instructions using the
environment variables, there is a cure, described in the next paragraph.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enabling-debug-via-rsyslog-conf">
<h2>Enabling Debug via rsyslog.conf<a class="headerlink" href="#enabling-debug-via-rsyslog-conf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As described in the previous paragraph, enabling debug via rsyslog.conf
may not be perfect for some debugging needs, but basic debug output will
work - and that is what most often is required. There are limited
options available, but these cover the most important use cases.</p>
<p>Debug processing is done via legacy config statements. There currently
is no plan to move these over to the v6+ config system. Available
settings are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>$DebugFile &lt;filename&gt; - sets the debug file name</li>
<li>$DebugLevel &lt;0|1|2&gt; - sets the respective debug level, where 0
means debug off, 1 is debug on demand activated (but debug mode off)
and 2 is full debug mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in theory it is forbidden to specify these parameters more
than once. However, we do not enforce that and if it happens results are
undefined.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-debug-information-from-a-running-instance">
<h2>Getting debug information from a running Instance<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-debug-information-from-a-running-instance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to obtain debugging information from a running instance,
but this requires some setup. We assume that the instance runs in the
background, so debug output to stdout is not desired. As such, all debug
information needs to go into a log file.</p>
<p>To create this setup, you need to</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>point the RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG environment variable to a file that is
accessible during the while runtime (we strongly suggest a file in
the local file system!)</li>
<li>set RSYSLOG_DEBUG at least to “DebugOnDeman NoStdOut”</li>
<li>make sure these environment variables are set in the correct
(distro-specifc) startup script if you do not run rsyslogd
interactively</li>
</ul>
<p>These settings enable the capability to react to SIGUSR1. The signal
will toggle debug status when received. So send it once to turn debug
logging on, and send it again to turn debug logging off again. The third
time it will be turned on again … and so on.</p>
<p>On a typical system, you can signal rsyslogd as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid`
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Important: there are backticks around the “cat”-command. If you use the
regular quote it won’t work. The debug log will show whether debug
logging has been turned on or off. There is no other indication of the
status.</p>
<p>Note: running with DebugOnDemand by itself does in practice not have any
performance toll. However, switching debug logging on has a severe
performance toll. Also, debug logging synchronizes much of the code,
removing a lot of concurrency and thus potential race conditions. As
such, the very same running instance may behave very differently with
debug logging turned on vs. off. The on-demand debug log functionality
is considered to be very valuable to analyze hard-to-find bugs that only
manifest after a long runtime. Turning debug logging on a failing
instance may reveal the cause of the failure. However, depending on the
failure, debug logging may not even be successfully turned on. Also
note that with this rsyslog version we cannot obtain any debug
information on events that happened <em>before</em> debug logging was turned
on.</p>
<p>If an instance hangs, it is possible to obtain some useful information
about the current threads and their calling stack by sending SIGUSR2.
However, the usefulness of that information is very much depending on
rsyslog compile-time settings, must importantly the –enable-rtinst
configure flag. Note that activating this option causes additional
overhead and slows down rsyslgod considerable. So if you do that, you
need to check if it is capable to handle the workload. Also, threading
behavior is modified by the runtime instrumentation.</p>
<p>Sending SIGUSR2 writes new process state information to the log file
each time it is sent. So it may be useful to do that from time to time.
It probably is most useful if the process seems to hang, in which case
it may (may!) be able to output some diagnostic information on the
current processing state. In that case, turning on the mutex debugging
options (see above) is probably useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interpreting-the-logs">
<h2>Interpreting the Logs<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-the-logs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Debug logs are primarily meant for rsyslog developers. But they may
still provide valuable information to users. Just be warned that logs
sometimes contains information the looks like an error, but actually is
none. We put a lot of extra information into the logs, and there are
some cases where it is OK for an error to happen, we just wanted to
record it inside the log. The code handles many cases automatically. So,
in short, the log may not make sense to you, but it (hopefully) makes
sense to a developer. Note that we developers often need many lines of
the log file, it is relatively rare that a problem can be diagnosed by
looking at just a couple of (hundred) log records.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="security-risks">
<h2>Security Risks<a class="headerlink" href="#security-risks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The debug log will reveal potentially sensible information, including
user accounts and passwords, to anyone able to read the log file. As
such, it is recommended to properly guard access to the log file. Also,
an instance running with debug log enabled runs much slower than one
without. An attacker may use this to place carry out a denial-of-service
attack or try to hide some information from the log file. As such, it is
suggested to enable DebugOnDemand mode only for a reason. Note that when
no debug mode is enabled, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are completely ignored.</p>
<p>When running in any of the debug modes (including on demand mode), an
interactive instance of rsyslogd can be aborted by pressing ctl-c.</p>
