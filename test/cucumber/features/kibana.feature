  #Scenario Outline: A user's kibana index is only seeded once

    mappings for the indices that are visible to them.

        #Given a user with the role of<role>
    Given a user with the role of operations
    And the user has never used Kibana
    #    And log were collected for the <project> project
    And logs were collected for the operations project
    And they log into Kibana
    #And refresh <project> index pattern field list
    And refresh operations index pattern field list
    When they log into Kibana again
    Then the index mapping fields should remain unchanged

    #    Examples:
    #  | role       | project    |
    #  | operations | operations |
    #   #| developer  | myproject |

  Scenario: The .all alias references all indices

    Given a user with the role of operations
    And the .all alias initially does not exist
    And logs were collected for the logging project
    When they log into Kibana
    Then the .all alias should alias indices: operations, logging
